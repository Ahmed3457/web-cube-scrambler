# Web Cube scrambler
I made this since [**cubedesk**](https://cubedesk.io) doesn't have Last Layer scrambles and F2L scrambles
# Running locally
if you are using windows you can use the pre-built binaries but if you are on mac os or linux you have to run it from the source code
you need the following :
1. Python 3.8
2. Pip 3 
3. NodeJs (Required for the scrambling library)
4. Git (optional)

The **First step** is to clone this repo
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed3457/web-cube-scrambler
```
alternatively you can just download the source code from the Github web interface

The **Second step** is to install the libraries
```bash
cd web-cube-scrambler
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
the **Third step** is just to run the file
```bash
python main.py
```
if you encounter any Errors please open an **Issue**
